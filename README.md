# Gemini Vibe: The AI-Powered Podcast Platform

## Project Vision

**Gemini Vibe** is a next-generation podcasting platform designed to automate and enhance the entire content creation lifecycle. Our goal is to leverage the power of Google's Gemini AI and Google Cloud services to make podcasting faster, easier, and more creative.

This project will handle everything from idea generation and recording via Google Meet to post-production with a signature AI-powered **"Vibe Editing"** feature.

## Core Features

-   **Seamless Google Meet Integration:** Record podcasts directly from Google Meet, with automated transcription and speaker identification.
-   **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Use Gemini to generate podcast ideas, create interview question sheets, and write entire scripts.
-   **"Vibe Editing" Engine:** Our killer feature. Automatically rewrite and style podcast transcripts to match a desired tone or "vibe" (e.g., "Casual Banter," "Professional News Report," "Humorous Tech Chat").
-   **Automated Post-Production:** Generate show notes, summaries, and social media content from your recording.

## Current Status

This project is under active development. We are currently in the research and architectural planning phase. See [MASTER_PLAN.md](MASTER_PLAN.md) for the detailed development roadmap.
